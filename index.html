      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
       I am starting a new chapter in my life and Code has given me the perfect opportunity to do so and reconnect with design. Having completed a very exciting and complete Bootcamp with Le Wagon where i learned Ruby, Ruby on rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS and wierframe prototyping. Code has helped me reconnect with design. I am commited and determined to trun the page and start creating a better life for myself.
      For starters im currentyl working to develop a Monogamy dating website. Currentlty working on an exciting art project installation with Helping Hands Leamington Spa, for the ladies group, called "Burnt - A collection of local Love stories"

      <h2>Something im into</h2>
      <p>Interactive Digital Installations</p>
      <p>
      I have been intrested in Interactive Digital art and augmented reality for a while now. One of the first artisit i came across was  <a href="https://www.sianfan.com/" class="link-to-site">Sian Fan</a>
      </p>

      <a href="#" class="link-to-site">This is how you really do it</a>

      <h2>A book I recomend </h2>
      <p>
        I would recomend you to read <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/be-more-pirate/sam-conniff-allende/9780241307885" class="link-to-site">Be more pirate</a> by Sam Conniff. Amazing book and a very key important message to learn form it, to never give up on yourself rethink leadership and creativity.
